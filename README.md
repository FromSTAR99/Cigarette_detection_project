# Cigarette_detection_project
Cigarette detection project is an artificial intelligence-based system that detects cigarettes and raises an alarm, with or without Arduino. If the comment variable in the 6th line of the ".py" extension file is 1, the project will run without Arduino. If updated to 0 it will work with Arduino.
